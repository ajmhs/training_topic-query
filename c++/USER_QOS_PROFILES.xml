or inability to use the software.

The QoS configuration of the DDS entities in the generated example is loaded 
from this file.

This file is used only when it is in the current working directory or when the
environment variable NDDS_QOS_PROFILES is defined and points to this file.

The profile in this file inherits from the builtin QoS profile 
BuiltinQosLib::Generic.StrictReliable. That profile, along with all of the 
other built-in QoS profiles can be found in the 
BuiltinProfiles.documentationONLY.xml file located in the 
$NDDSHOME/resource/xml/ directory.

You may use any of these QoS configurations in your application simply by 
referring to them by the name shown in the 
BuiltinProfiles.documentationONLY.xml file.

Also, following the QoS Profile composition pattern you can use QoS Snippets
to easily create your final QoS Profile. For further information visit:
https://community.rti.com/best-practices/qos-profile-inheritance-and-composition-guidance

There is a QoS Snippet library that contains a collection of
QoS Snippets that set some specific features or configurations. You can find
them in the BuiltinProfiles.documentationONLY.xml file as well.

You should not edit the file BuiltinProfiles.documentationONLY.xml directly.
However, if you wish to modify any of the values in a built-in profile, the
recommendation is to create a profile of your own and inherit from the built-in
profile you wish to modify. The NDDS_QOS_PROFILES.example.xml file (contained in 
the same directory as the BuiltinProfiles.documentationONLY.xml file) shows how
to inherit from the built-in profiles. 

For more information about XML QoS Profiles see the "Configuring QoS with
XML" chapter in the RTI Connext DDS Core Libraries User's Manual.
